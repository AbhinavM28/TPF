# TPF - Talking Photo Frame
  
This is an ongoing LLM framework for a conversational chatbot end-device curated for specific users to feel like they are talking to a real person of their choosing

## Realeases
  **V1.0** - Initial concept designed and prototyped by borrowing a framework from established LLM architecture and utilizing APIs from OpenAI and Google to deliver a low-fidelity conversational experience.
  
  **Demo Video - Screen Capture**

###### (Under development)
**V2.0** - Refactored code will address issues from V1.0 and implement new features.

## 💝 The Story Behind This Project

This project was born from a deeply personal place. After my grandmother passed away
a few years back, I saw how much my mother missed having conversations with her.
I wanted to create something that could bring comfort and connection, even if just for a moment.

TPF is meant to be a working prototype that demonstrates the concept. While V1.0 has
significant limitations (32-second response time, generic voice, etc.), it proved
the emotional value of the idea. My mother's reaction when she first used it
validated that this is worth pursuing and improving.

V2.0 will address all the technical shortcomings to make this a truly meaningful
tool for grieving families and anyone missing a loved one. Hoping to gain valuable
feedback and develop this idea deeper, one version at a time.
