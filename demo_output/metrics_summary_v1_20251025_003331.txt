PERFORMANCE RATING
============================================================

Latency Rating:
  ✗ POOR - Significant latency issues

Reliability Rating:
  ✓ EXCELLENT - Very reliable

Bottleneck Analysis:
  ⚠ BOTTLENECK: Speech recognition
    → Recommendation: Use local Whisper model for V2.0
  ⚠ BOTTLENECK: Text-to-speech
    → Recommendation: Optimize with local TTS + voice cloning

Recommendations for V2.0:
  1. Implement local LLM (Ollama) to eliminate API latency
  2. Use Whisper for faster local speech recognition
  3. Add voice cloning for authentic grandmother voice
  4. Implement face animation for dynamic visuals
  5. Optimize ambient noise handling for better recognition
